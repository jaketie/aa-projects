        <h2>so what is this all about</h2>

            <p class="blogText">
                it all started back in 2022. I wanted to start a new career and thought "hey, I like computers, and I've always liked the idea of learning how to code and working in tandem with other people on big projects" and well, that was pretty much it actually.
            </p>

        <h2>and how's that going</h2>
            <p class="blogText">I'm working on my first major project: a website! that's what this is. so far I feel pretty good about how it's going. I found html to be pretty easy to wrap my head around and it's fun messing with CSS and seeing how much I can mess with the site's appearance. I'm still in the early stuff though so we'll see how I feel about it later.</p>

        <h2 class="blogText"> alright is there anything else going on</h2>
            <p>
                yeah I have a dog. his name is Tucker. here is a big picture of his goofy face. there are even more on the cool page I made for him.
